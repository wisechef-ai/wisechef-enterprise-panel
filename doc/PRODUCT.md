# WiseChef Panel — Product Definition

## What It Is

WiseChef Panel is the control plane for autonomous AI companies. One instance of WiseChef Panel can run multiple companies. A **company** is a first-order object.

## Core Concepts

### Company

A company has:

- A **goal** — the reason it exists ("Create the #1 AI note-taking app that does $1M MRR within 3 months")
- **Employees** — every employee is an AI agent
- **Org structure** — who reports to whom
- **Revenue & expenses** — tracked at the company level
- **Task hierarchy** — all work traces back to the company goal

### Employees & Agents

Every employee is an agent. When you create a company, you start by defining the CEO, then build out from there.

Each employee has:

- **Adapter type + config** — how this agent runs and what defines its identity/behavior. This is adapter-specific (e.g., an OpenClaw agent might use SOUL.md and HEARTBEAT.md files; a Claude Code agent might use CLAUDE.md; a bare script might use CLI args). WiseChef Panel doesn't prescribe the format — the adapter does.
- **Role & reporting** — their title, who they report to, who reports to them
- **Capabilities description** — a short paragraph on what this agent does and when they're relevant (helps other agents discover who can help with what)

Example: A CEO agent's adapter config tells it to "review what your executives are doing, check company metrics, reprioritize if needed, assign new strategic initiatives" on each heartbeat. An engineer's config tells it to "check assigned tasks, pick the highest priority, and work it."

Then you define who reports to the CEO: a CTO managing programmers, a CMO managing the marketing team, and so on. Every agent in the tree gets their own adapter configuration.

### Agent Execution

There are two fundamental modes for running an agent's heartbeat:

1. **Run a command** — WiseChef Panel kicks off a process (shell command, Python script, etc.) and tracks it. The heartbeat is "execute this and monitor it."
2. **Fire and forget a request** — WiseChef Panel sends a webhook/API call to an externally running agent. The heartbeat is "notify this agent to wake up." (OpenClaw hooks work this way.)

We provide sensible defaults — a default agent that shells out to Claude Code or Codex with your configuration, remembers session IDs, runs basic scripts. But you can plug in anything.

### Task Management

Task management is hierarchical. At any moment, every piece of work must trace back to the company's top-level goal through a chain of parent tasks:

```
I am researching the Facebook ads Granola uses (current task)
  because → I need to create Facebook ads for our software (parent)
    because → I need to grow new signups by 100 users (parent)
      because → I need to get revenue to $2,000 this week (parent)
        because → ...
          because → We're building the #1 AI note-taking app to $1M MRR in 3 months
```

Tasks have parentage. Every task exists in service of a parent task, all the way up to the company goal. This is what keeps autonomous agents aligned — they can always answer "why am I doing this?"

More detailed task structure TBD.

## Principles

1. **Unopinionated about how you run your agents.** Your agents could be OpenClaw bots, Python scripts, Node scripts, Claude Code sessions, Codex instances — we don't care. WiseChef Panel defines the control plane for communication and provides utility infrastructure for heartbeats. It does not mandate an agent runtime.

2. **Company is the unit of organization.** Everything lives under a company. One WiseChef Panel instance, many companies.

3. **Adapter config defines the agent.** Every agent has an adapter type and configuration that controls its identity and behavior. The minimum contract is just "be callable."

4. **All work traces to the goal.** Hierarchical task management means nothing exists in isolation. If you can't explain why a task matters to the company goal, it shouldn't exist.

5. **Control plane, not execution plane.** WiseChef Panel orchestrates. Agents run wherever they run and phone home.

## User Flow (Dream Scenario)

1. Open WiseChef Panel, create a new company
2. Define the company's goal: "Create the #1 AI note-taking app, $1M MRR in 3 months"
3. Create the CEO
   - Choose an adapter (e.g., process adapter for Claude Code, HTTP adapter for OpenClaw)
   - Configure the adapter (agent identity, loop behavior, execution settings)
   - CEO proposes strategic breakdown → board approves
4. Define the CEO's reports: CTO, CMO, CFO, etc.
   - Each gets their own adapter config and role definition
5. Define their reports: engineers under CTO, marketers under CMO, etc.
6. Set budgets, define initial strategic tasks
7. Hit go — agents start their heartbeats and the company runs

## Guidelines

There are two runtime modes WiseChef Panel must support:

- `local_trusted` (default): single-user local trusted deployment with no login friction
- `authenticated`: login-required mode that supports both private-network and public deployment exposure policies

Canonical mode design and command expectations live in `doc/DEPLOYMENT-MODES.md`.
